## Notes
At first I didn’t know how to connect the button to the Swift file, but I figured it out with Control-drag. I also saw some layout warnings, but they didn’t affect the app’s functionality.

My App Idea
My app idea is a **Healthy Habits Tracker** Tracker that helps people stick to routines. Users can add custom habits like drinking water or walking, receive reminders, and see streaks to stay motivated. Simple charts would show weekly or monthly progress, and users could share progress with friends for extra accountability.
